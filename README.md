# LeetCode Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Problem Solving Repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems on LeetCode. It's a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structure problems solved in multiple programming languages. The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and provide a valuable resource for other developers.

## Features

Diverse Problem Set: Solutions to problems across different categories such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
Multiple Programming Languages: Solutions are implemented in various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
Optimized Code: Focus on writing clean, efficient, and optimized code with proper documentation and comments.
Algorithmic Techniques: Implementation of various algorithmic techniques such as recursion, backtracking, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming.
Unit Tests: Comprehensive test cases included for each solution to ensure correctness and robustness.

## Structure

### The repository is structured as follows:

Problems: Each problem has its own directory named after the problem title. Inside each directory, you'll find:
README.md: A brief description of the problem, its constraints, and examples.
Solution.[language]: The solution file(s) in different programming languages.
test_[problem_name].[language]: Test cases for the solution.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution or optimization, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and includes test cases.
